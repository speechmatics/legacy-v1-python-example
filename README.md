# Legacy V1 Python Example

Example script (supported) to help you integrate with our legacy V1 API.

This code was developed and tested with Python 2.7.12 and Python 3.5.2   

This is an example script for uploading audio files and saving the transcript in a .json file  

> NOTE: For information on how to use the current V2 Speechmatics API,
> see [speechmatics-python](https://github.com/speechmatics/speechmatics-python) repository.


## Requirements

You will need to have the requests module installed in your Python environment.  

```
pip install requests
```

## Example usage:
```
python ./speechmatics.py -a example.mp3 -l en-US -i $user_id -k $auth_token -o example.json  
```

In this example the script uploads `example.mp3`, transcribes it using our en-US speech to text product and saves the resulting transcription as `example.json` file when the job has completed.
